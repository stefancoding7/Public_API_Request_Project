 <h1>Public API request project</h1>

 Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address

<h2>Document style changes</h2>
I added linear background color and changed template style to cube style(no border-radius). 

Added text shadows for every card element. 

Also changed font into "roboto".
